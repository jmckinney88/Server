Removal of requirement of EQCrypto.dll.  

This means we have the encryption key for our client.  Guard this key
very carefully, it's basically all that stands between problems with man 
in the middle attacks against our login server.  Also, it may not have 
been changed for the client used by EQEmu.  Please respect our heritage 
to their work and do not share this key.

The removal of the DLL was done very quickly and very poorly.  It seems 
to have worked well enough for my limited testing, but the code has 
become MORE unreadable now.  I plan on completely re-writting this login 
server to better suit our needs but for now it's what we have.

The encryption used is DES-cdc with a rotating vector.  We're using 
OpenSSL for this funtionality as it's fast as lightning and easy to 
use.  This means there are some new steps to getting the build 
environment set up.

Install OpenSSL for Windows:
    http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
    
    You will need the Win32 OpenSSL v0.9.8k (7MB installer) and probably 
    the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables from that site since the 
    jack-ass is building from a weird version of Visual Studio.
    
Add folders to directories:
    The installer will ask where you want it.  I put it in C:\OpenSSL 
    (the default.  You will need to add the bin, include and lib/VC 
    folders to the directories in Visual Studio (tools, options, you 
    know...)
    
Add linker dependancies to project:
    I think I got the file set up so it will work, but just in case, add 
    ssleay32MT.lib and libeay32MT.lib to the list of libraries for the 
    Release configuration. (it's under linker, input)
    
That should get the build done correctly.  I know the code is a little 
hackity hacked together, but I wanted to get that damn DLL out of our 
lives as quickly as possible, who knows what it's doing in there.  Also, 
naming my PC "athlon" pisses me off.

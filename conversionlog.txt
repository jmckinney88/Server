NOTE: I created a new branch because of the way that my previous commits were performed. The previous commits were done in such a
      way that trying to discern what was actually done was near impossible. I will try to keep the commits a little more organized -U
	  
Uleat: Created branch 'inventory_conversion_2' based on 'master' Revision 2331678 (commit 469) (The old one will be removed)
